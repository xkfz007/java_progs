Abstract¡ªIn this paper, a new technique coined two-dimensional principal
component analysis (2DPCA) is developed for image representation. As opposed
to PCA, 2DPCA is based on 2D image matrices rather than 1D vectors so the image
matrix does not need to be transformed into a vector prior to feature extraction.
Instead, an image covariance matrix is constructed directly using the original image
matrices, and its eigenvectors are derived for image feature extraction. To test
2DPCA and evaluate its performance, a series of experiments were performed on
three face image databases: ORL, AR, and Yale face databases. The recognition
rate across all trials was higher using 2DPCA than PCA. The experimental results
also indicated that the extraction of image features is computationally more efficient
using 2DPCA than PCA.

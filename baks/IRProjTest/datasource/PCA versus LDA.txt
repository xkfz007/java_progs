PCA versus LDA

Abstract?In the context of the appearance-based paradigm for object
recognition, it is generally believed that algorithms based on LDA (Linear
Discriminant Analysis) are superior to those based on PCA (Principal Components
Analysis). In this communication, we show that this is not always the case. We
present our case first by using intuitively plausible arguments and, then, by
showing actual results on a face database. Our overall conclusion is that when the
training data set is small, PCA can outperform LDA and, also, that PCA is less
sensitive to different training data sets.
Index Terms?Face recognition, pattern recognition, principal components
analysis, linear discriminant analysis, learning from undersampled distributions,
small training data sets.

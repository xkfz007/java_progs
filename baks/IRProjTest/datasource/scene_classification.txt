Abstract
This paper describes our work on classification of outdoor
scenes. First, images are partitioned into regions using
one-class classification and patch-based clustering algorithms
where one-class classifiers model the regions with
relatively uniform color and texture properties, and clustering
of patches aims to detect structures in the remaining
regions. Next, the resulting regions are clustered to obtain
a codebook of region types, and two models are constructed
for scene representation: a ¡°bag of individual regions¡±
representation where each region is regarded separately,
and a ¡°bag of region pairs¡± representation where
regions with particular spatial relationships are considered
together. Given these representations, scene classification is
done using Bayesian classifiers. We also propose a novel region
selection algorithm that identifies region types that are
frequently found in a particular class of scenes but rarely
exist in other classes, and also consistently occur together
in the same class of scenes. Experiments on the LabelMe
data set showed that the proposed models significantly outperform
a baseline global feature-based approach.
